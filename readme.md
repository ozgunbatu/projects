Star: CoolSiC 800V (high growth, high share)
Cash Cow: OptiMOS Silicon (low growth, high share)
Question Mark: HybridPACK integrated modules
Dog: Legacy IGBT (decline phase)




3. KEY INSIGHTS - Neler Keşfettik?
Insight #1: Massive Pricing Gap

Nasıl bulduk: TEV analysis comparing customer value vs. current pricing
Veri: Customer gains €2,444 value, Infineon charges only €143 premium
Sonuç: 94% of value goes to customer → huge pricing opportunity
Recommendation: Increase ASP by 18% (still 75% value to customer)

Insight #2: Volume OEM = Sweet Spot

Nasıl bulduk: Segment profitability matrix (growth vs. margin)
Veri: 24% CAGR + 28% margin + platform standardization
Competitor action: VW ID.Next, GM Ultium Gen 2, Ford transitioning 2025-2027
Sonuç: Perfect timing window for design wins

Insight #3: Technology Moat is Strong

Nasıl bulduk: Competitive benchmarking table
Veri: Infineon CoolSiC™ 98.5% efficiency vs. ST 98.1% vs. ON 97.8%
Power density: 45 kW/L vs. competitors 40-42 kW/L
Sonuç: Technology leadership justifies 15-20% price premium

Insight #4: China Price Pressure

Nasıl bulduk: Win/Loss analysis + competitive intelligence
Example: Lost BYD Atto 3 to ON Semi (18% lower bid)
Root cause: Insufficient TCO value communication
Recommendation: Enhanced financial modeling tools for sales team


4. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS - Ne Yapmalı?

🎯 SUNUM İÇİN KRİTİK MESAJLAR

"We identified a €2.4B value creation opportunity hiding in plain sight" → Value-based pricing gap
"The 2025-2027 window is a once-in-a-decade inflection point" → 400V→800V transition timing
"Technology leadership without pricing power is value destruction" → Currently leaving money on table
"Volume OEMs are the Goldilocks segment" → Not too hot (competitive), not too cold (slow), just right (growth+margin)
"€980M EBITDA from smart strategy, not just more capacity" → Product management drives value
